                     <h3>On arrival visa in Nepal</h3> 
<p>People from most countries are eligible to receive an on-arrival visa in Nepal.</p> 

<p>Tribhuvan International Airport is the only international airport of Nepal. Immigration Office, TIA (Tribhuvan International Airport) under Department of Immigration has been facilitating tourists flying to Nepal by providing Visa on Arrival. Likewise, other Entry and Exit points established at the border regions also provide ' On Arrival Visa' to foreign nationals hoping to enter Nepal via land.</p>

<p>'On Arrival' visa procedure is very quick and simple. You can expect some queues during peak Tourist season. If you wish to skip those queues, you can also consider getting Visa from Nepalese Diplomatic Missions stationed abroad prior to your arrival. Choice is yours.
 If you have obtained visa from Nepalese Diplomatic Missions, then you must enter Nepal within six months from the visa issued date. Your total stay is counted starting from the day you enter into Nepal.</p>

<p>ON Arrival Visas are 'Tourist Visas'.  They bear multiple Re entry facility. Tourist Visa 'On Arrival' is the only entry visa to Nepal. If you are visiting Nepal for the purposes other than Tourism (sightseeing, tour, travel, mountaineering, trekking, visiting friends and families), you should still get ' Tourist Visa' to get into the country.  However, you must change the category of visa as per your purpose and length of stay in Nepal from Department of Immigration by producing required documents.</p>

<p>Nationals of designated countries are requested to acquire Visa prior their arrival from their nearby Diplomatic missions (Embassies/consulates) of Nepal Government.</p>

<p>Once you arrive at the airport, please follow these simple procedures for Tourist Visa on Arrival.</p>
 
<ol> 
<li>

If you fill it from the website, you will get submission Receipt with barcode, please print it out and bring it along for acquiring visa. It works for fifteen days and becomes invalid then after.  If so, you will have to fill it up again.
</li>
 
<li>      
<p>Make payment  at the bank according to your visa requirement ( 15/30/90 Days) and get the receipt</p>
    
<p>While you can use different modes of payments (at visa fees collection counter), we advise you to carry some cash to be on the safe side.</p>

<li>15 Days:  25 USD</li>
<li>30 Days:  40 USD</li>
<li>90 Days:  100 USD</li>
</ul>
